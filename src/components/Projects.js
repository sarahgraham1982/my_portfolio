        <h4>An information resource for people who wear band t-shirts purely for fashion reasons and not because they are fans of the band. The user, when prompted to 'prove' they are worthy of wearing said t-shirt by a disgruntled, gate-keeping fan, can use this app for band trivia that only fans would know!</h4>

      <h3><strong>GIVE & GET</strong></h3>
      <h4>An app for incentivising volunteers with tangible discounts and rewards. During the pandemic, charities saw a decrease in volunteers, charity shops were closed and there was an increase in the need for charities such as Womens Aid and Domestic Abuse charities. We created a brand new concept in volunteering apps that does not currently exist with the goal of increasing volunteer numbers.</h4>

        <p>A group Javascript project, completed in 7 days, utilizing React, MongoDB, HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>This project was very exciting to work on as it was a brand new idea that previously didn't exist. It was exciting and rewarding to be a part of something that could potentially help people.</p>
